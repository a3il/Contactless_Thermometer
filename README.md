# Contactless_Thermometer
Contactless thermometer is a autonomous arduino system for creating measuring temperature of a human and displaying it  on an app along with detecting the person with a LIDAR.

The current COVID-19 scenario needs no introduction.it is important to act responsibly and tackle this problem collectively. Today in many public places and in other gatherings, it has become common to screen individuals for body temperature, as a preventive measure to check for fever. There are many devices commonly available today in the market like the IR gun but all requires some form of human contact. Our project solves this problem and allows accurate and precise readings without human contact where the temperature readings are transmitted to a mobile phone app with GUI. Our project is a low cost interactive, contactless and safe implementation to be used in This project is a cost effective, multi-purpose and accurate real-life solution.

THE project is a simple solution that will add an accurate thermal screening feature to your smartphone using a MLX90614 infrared sensor module and Arduino UNO R3. Our project basically has only two units: transmitter (IR sensor /Lidar) and receiver (mobile) along with buzzers to indicate over limit readings. Tf mini lidar was added a detector to start mlx90614 reading under a pre-set distance. HC-05 is used as a serial interface Bluetooth module to transmit the readings to the smartphone app.Kodular.io open source api was used to create the app with gui. Our project is integrated into a box and screwed on to a tripod using the adapter for proper real life working in places like schools, hospitals etc.

There are two arduinos used,they communicate by i2c.
